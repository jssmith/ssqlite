1. 3 newly added files message.py worker.py coordinator.py. Copy them into the old pytpcc directory.
2. Coordinator is the main part. Use it like the old tpcc.py. e.g., python coordinator.py --config hypertable.config --clientprocs 5 hypertable
3. Old argument --clients is replaced with --clientprocs, which specifies how many worker processes you want to run on each client node.
4. All clientnodes(name or ip) must be specified in the configure file.
5. The directory of the code on the client side should be specified in the configure file,too. The default address is user's home address, which is default using ssh.
   It should remain the same for each client node, which is not a problem for now.
6. Execnet python module should be installed on each client. Here is how to install it. http://codespeak.net/execnet/install.html
